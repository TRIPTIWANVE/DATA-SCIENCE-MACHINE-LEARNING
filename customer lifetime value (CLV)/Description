Predict customer lifetime value (CLV)

Customer Lifetime Value is a monetary value that represents
the amount of revenue a customer will provide the business over the lifetime of the relationship. 

Several numerical techniques exist in computing Customer Lifetime Value, but we can compute CLV 
reliably only for customers who have a significant purchase history with the company. But how can
we compute this for a recent customer? Well, predictive analytics is here to help. The goal of 
this use case to build a regression model that can predict the Customer Lifetime Value for a
new or recent customer, based on his or her recent buying patterns.
